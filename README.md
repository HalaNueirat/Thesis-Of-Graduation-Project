Abstract

This app was developed because navigating across huge, complex buildings like the Engineering Faculty at the Aab American
University (AAUP) can be challenging and new students can be confused as to whether what is in the hall is a lecture for 
them or not.  The Engineering Faculty Compass application was developed by using Unity platform, this app uses augmented 
reality (AR) to help new students find lecture halls by scanning the Quick Response (QR) code on the floor where the target
hall is located, then selecting the desired hall from appeared halls list and following the line renderer that will appear 
until they reach the hall, in order to draw a shorter path from the QR code position to the desired hall, this app used A*
Algorithm to calculate the shortest path by divide each floor plan to grid and determine nodes inside it then draw the final
path between the nodes that have the lowest costs.  When the user reach the target hall there will be a smart screen hanging 
on the hall door display the lecture information used Screen Cloud software, this information including the name,time, number
of students, the teacher, and the next lecture. The playlist is changed regularly, as it varies depending on the lectures offered
by the university.
